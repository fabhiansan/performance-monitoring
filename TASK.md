# Improvement
1. Employee button
After I upload Employees, I still see Improt Employee Data in Overview and Analytics, and other pages except Manage Employees. The button should be hidden since we already have the Pegawai Data

# Bug
1. Staff Change Missmatch
If I change staff/other to eselon, and back to overview, the name still shows as Staff/Other. It should be changed to Eselon. This also causing the related staff cannot get Penilaian Pimpinan
