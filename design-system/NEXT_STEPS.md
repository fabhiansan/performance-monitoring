### Implementation Patterns to Follow
```typescript
// 1. Component Structure (follow Button.tsx):
export interface ComponentProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'element'> {
  variant?: 'default' | 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  // ... other props
}

export const Component = forwardRef<HTMLElement, ComponentProps>(
  ({ variant = 'default', size = 'md', className, ...props }, ref) => {
    const classes = componentVariants({ variant, size, className });
    return <element ref={ref} className={classes} {...props} />;
  }
);

// 2. Variant Utilities (follow existing pattern):
const componentVariants = createVariantUtil(baseClasses, {
  variant: {
    default: 'variant-specific-classes',
    primary: 'variant-specific-classes',
  },
  size: {
    sm: 'size-specific-classes',
    md: 'size-specific-classes',
  }
});

// 3. Accessibility (always include):
import { createFormFieldAria, generateId } from '../../utils/a11y';
const ariaAttributes = createFormFieldAria({ label, required, disabled });
```

### 4. Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
**Goal**: Enhance functionality and developer experience

**Features to add**:
- Theme Provider component for runtime theme switching
- Storybook integration for component development
- Additional utility components (Skeleton, Loading, etc.)
- Form validation helpers
- Animation presets

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Atomic Design**: Components built from atoms → molecules → organisms
   - **Why**: Scalable, maintainable, reusable across different contexts
   - **Impact**: Easy to extend and modify individual pieces

2. **Token-Based Design**: Semantic tokens map to primitive values
   - **Why**: Enables theming, consistency, and easy brand changes
   - **Impact**: Change brand colors in one place, affects entire system

3. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built-in
   - **Why**: Required for government applications, better UX for everyone
   - **Impact**: All components work with screen readers and keyboards

4. **TypeScript Throughout**: Full type safety and IntelliSense
   - **Why**: Prevents runtime errors, better developer experience
   - **Impact**: Catch errors at compile time, excellent autocomplete

### Technical Decisions

1. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Design tokens feed into Tailwind config
   - **Why**: Leverage existing Tailwind knowledge while standardizing values
   - **Impact**: Can use both design system components AND Tailwind utilities

2. **Compound Components**: Modal.Header, Card.Body, etc.
   - **Why**: Flexible composition while maintaining consistency
   - **Impact**: Developers can customize layout while keeping design standards

3. **forwardRef Usage**: All components support ref forwarding
   - **Why**: Integration with form libraries and focus management
   - **Impact**: Works seamlessly with React Hook Form, focus utilities

4. **CSS Custom Properties**: Runtime theming support
   - **Why**: Dynamic theme switching without JavaScript
   - **Impact**: Better performance, works with SSR

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### 1. Bundle Size
- **Current impact**: Minimal (tree-shakeable)
- **Watch out for**: Importing entire design system vs. individual components
- **Best practice**: `import { Button } from './design-system/components/Button'`

### 2. Breaking Changes
- **Existing styles**: May conflict with new foundation styles
- **Migration strategy**: Test thoroughly, migrate component by component
- **Rollback plan**: Foundation CSS can be removed easily

### 3. Performance
- **CSS**: Foundation styles add ~15KB gzipped
- **JS**: Each component adds ~2-5KB gzipped
- **Optimization**: Only import what you use

### 4. Accessibility Testing
- **Tools needed**: Screen reader (NVDA/JAWS), keyboard testing
- **Test scenarios**: Tab navigation, screen reader announcements, color contrast
- **Compliance**: Currently meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Adding New Components

1. **Research**: Check existing components for patterns
2. **Plan**: Define props interface and variants
3. **Build**: Follow existing component structure
4. **Test**: Accessibility, keyboard navigation, screen readers
5. **Document**: Add to README with examples

### Updating Tokens

1. **Primitive tokens**: Change in `tokens/primitives.ts`
2. **Semantic tokens**: Update in `tokens/semantic.ts`
3. **Test**: Verify changes work in light and dark modes
4. **Document**: Update examples if token names change

### Component Enhancement

1. **Backward compatibility**: Don't break existing props
2. **New variants**: Add to variant utility function
3. **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers after changes
4. **Documentation**: Update prop tables and examples

## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Minor Issues
1. **Tooltip component**: Not yet implemented (needed for help text)
2. **Form validation**: Basic validation only, needs comprehensive helpers
3. **Animation preferences**: Reduced motion support could be enhanced

### Future Improvements
1. **Storybook**: Would help with component development and documentation
2. **Visual regression testing**: Prevent style breaks during updates
3. **Bundle analysis**: Track size impact of new components
4. **Performance monitoring**: Track runtime performance of components
