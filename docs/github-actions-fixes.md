# GitHub Actions Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the GitHub Actions build issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Deprecated actions/upload-artifact v3

**Problem**: The `release-windows.yml` workflow was using the deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` which will stop working on January 30th, 2025.

**Fix**: Updated to `actions/upload-artifact@v4` in `/Volumes/San/employee-performance-analyzer/.github/workflows/release-windows.yml`

```yaml
# Before
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3

# After  
uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

### 2. Node.js Version Compatibility

**Problem**: The release workflow was using Node.js 22, which may have compatibility issues with some native modules.

**Fix**: Changed to Node.js 20.x for better stability and added npm caching:

```yaml
# Before
node-version: '22'

# After
node-version: '20.x'
cache: 'npm'
```

### 3. Windows Dependency Installation Issues

**Problem**: The Windows build was failing during dependency installation due to aggressive cleanup and missing fallbacks.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced dependency installation process with better error handling
- Added fallback from `npm ci` to `npm install` when package-lock.json is removed
- Added verification step for critical dependencies like better-sqlite3
- Improved Windows-specific installation in the main build workflow

### 4. Database Connection Test Failures

**Problem**: Database tests were failing because they used CommonJS `require()` syntax, but the project uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json).

**Fix**: Updated database test commands to use ES module syntax:

```bash
# Before
node -e "const db = require('better-sqlite3')(':memory:'); ..."

# After
node --input-type=module -e "import Database from 'better-sqlite3'; const db = new Database(':memory:'); ..."
```

### 5. Server Health Check Port Issues

**Problem**: Health check tests were trying to connect to port 3000, but the server actually runs on port 3002.

**Fix**: Updated all health check URLs from `localhost:3000/health` to `localhost:3002/health`

### 6. Native Module Verification

**Problem**: Native module verification in Windows build was using CommonJS syntax.

**Fix**: Updated to use ES module syntax with proper async/await handling:

```javascript
// Before
require('better-sqlite3')

// After
const Database = (await import('better-sqlite3')).default; const db = new Database(':memory:'); db.close();
```

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/release-windows.yml`
   - Updated upload-artifact to v4
   - Changed Node.js version to 20.x
   - Enhanced dependency installation process
   - Fixed native module verification

2. `.github/workflows/build.yml`
   - Fixed database connection test syntax
   - Updated server health check ports
   - Improved Windows dependency installation

## Testing the Fixes

### To test the Windows build:
1. Push a new tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`) to trigger the release workflow
2. Or manually trigger the "Release Windows" workflow from GitHub Actions

### To test the general build:
1. Push to main or develop branch to trigger the "Build and Test" workflow
2. Check that all matrix combinations (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS with Node 20.x) pass

## Expected Improvements

- ✅ Windows builds should complete successfully without artifact upload errors
- ✅ Dependency installation should be more reliable on Windows
- ✅ Database connection tests should pass on all platforms
- ✅ Server health checks should work correctly
- ✅ Native module verification should work with ES modules

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Monitor the builds**: Keep an eye on the first few builds after these changes to ensure everything works as expected.

2. **Consider pinning dependency versions**: If you continue to have issues, consider pinning specific versions of problematic dependencies in package.json.

3. **Update documentation**: Update any documentation that references the old port numbers or build processes.

4. **Backup strategy**: Consider setting up multiple artifact upload strategies if critical releases need to be guaranteed.
