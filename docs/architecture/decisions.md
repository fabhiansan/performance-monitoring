## Decisions

### 2024-09-18: Package Manager Standardization

**Decision:** Enforce pnpm as the exclusive package manager  
**Context:** Mixed usage between npm and pnpm causing dependency inconsistencies  
**Rationale:** pnpm provides better disk efficiency, faster installs, and stricter dependency isolation  
**Teams:** Team B (Platform & Data)  
**Status:** Approved

### 2024-09-18: ESLint Cognitive Complexity Limit

**Decision:** Reduce cognitive complexity limit from 25 to 20  
**Context:** Migration plan requires adherence to â‰¤20 complexity threshold  
**Rationale:** Improve code maintainability and reduce technical debt  
**Teams:** Team A, Team B  
**Status:** Approved

### 2024-09-18: Build Directory Cleanup

**Decision:** Remove entire build/ directory during migration  
**Context:** 95+ outdated .js files in build/ causing confusion  
**Rationale:** Clean slate approach ensures no legacy artifacts interfere with new build system  
**Teams:** Team B (Platform & Data)  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2024-09-18: Backend Technology Stack Addition

**Decision:** Add Fastify, Pino, Zod, and Supertest to technology stack  
**Context:** Migration plan requires modern backend tooling for Phase 3 modernization  
**Rationale:** Fastify provides better performance than Express, Pino for structured logging, Zod for type-safe validation, Supertest for API testing  
**Teams:** Team B (Platform & Data)  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2024-09-18: TypeScript Configuration Enhancement

**Decision:** Add comprehensive path aliases and create tsconfig.playwright.json  
**Context:** Improve developer experience and prepare for E2E testing infrastructure  
**Rationale:** Path aliases reduce import complexity, separate Playwright config enables better test tooling  
**Teams:** Team B (Platform & Data)  
**Status:** Implemented

### 2024-09-18: CI/CD Migration to pnpm

**Decision:** Migrate GitHub Actions workflow from npm to pnpm with proper caching  
**Context:** Consistency with package manager standardization and improved CI performance  
**Rationale:** Faster builds, better caching, consistent with development environment  
**Teams:** Team B (Platform & Data)  
**Status:** Implemented
