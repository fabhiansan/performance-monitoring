# Migration Plan ‚Äì Employee Performance Analyzer

This document outlines the end-to-end plan for reworking the Employee Performance Analyzer into a modern, maintainable stack while preserving existing functionality. The plan is broken into phases so the team can execute incrementally and keep the system releasable between milestones.

---

## 1. Objectives & Success Criteria
- Replace ad-hoc UI logic with modular, testable React code (hooks + presentational components).
- Adopt a consistent, type-safe tooling stack (TypeScript-first, strict linting, automated tests).
- Simplify data access and validation flows on the backend while maintaining Electron distribution.
- Remove dead/unneeded assets left from prior JavaScript builds.
- Establish CI/CD gates (lint, unit tests, E2E smoke) to prevent regressions.
- Deliver feature parity for existing dashboards, imports, and PDF/report flows.

Success is achieved when the rewritten application ships on the new stack with passing automated checks, users experience no functional regressions, and the old JavaScript-era code paths are fully retired.

---

## 2. Target Tech Stack & Tooling

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19 + Vite + TypeScript (strict), JSX runtime enabled.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS backed by design tokens (`constants/designTokens.ts`), CSS Modules for any bespoke needs, Radix UI or Headless UI for accessible primitives.
- **State & Data**: TanStack Query for async server data, Zustand (or jotai) for cross-cutting client state, React Context for theme/config only.
- **Forms & Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod schemas to validate uploads and manual entries.
- **Data Presentation**: TanStack Table for tabular data, Recharts (or Nivo if richer charts required) for analytics visuals.
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library for unit/DOM tests, MSW for API mocking, Playwright for cross-platform E2E.
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint (TypeScript + React + SonarJS rules) enforcing cognitive complexity thresholds, Prettier (aligned with two-space indentation).

### Backend / Services
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+.
- **Framework**: Fastify (preferred) or modernized Express with async handlers, strict typing via TypeScript.
- **Persistence**: SQLite for embedded deployments *or* Postgres via Prisma/Kysely if scaling is required; include migration scripts with Drizzle or Prisma Migrate.
- **Validation**: Zod shared schemas with frontend to prevent drift.
- **Logging & Metrics**: Pino for structured logs, optional OpenTelemetry hooks.
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit/service tests, Supertest (or Fastify inject) for API specs.

### Desktop Packaging
- **Electron**: Upgrade to Electron 31 (or evaluate Tauri 2.0 for reduced footprint); keep auto-updater pipeline.
- **Builder**: `electron-builder` configured for Win/Mac/Linux artifacts in `release/`.

### Dev Experience & CI
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (already declared) ‚Äì enforce via `.npmrc` and CI checks.
- **Task Runner**: Leverage npm scripts + `turbo` or `concurrently` for parallel workflows.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions matrix running lint, unit tests, backend tests, Playwright smoke, build verification.
- **Code Quality**: SonarCloud (optional) or CodeQL for security scanning.

## 3. Team Structure & Parallel Workstreams

- **Team A ‚Äì Experience & Desktop**
  - Owns React/Vite frontend, design system, state management, and Electron shell integration.
  - Coordinates closely with UX and QA to validate user journeys, accessibility, and desktop behaviors.
- **Team B ‚Äì Platform & Data**
  - Owns backend services, database migrations, shared schemas, build tooling, and CI/CD.
  - Maintains deployment scripts, packaging, and ensures API contracts stay stable.
- **Joint Coordination**
  - Weekly cross-team architecture sync.
  - Daily async standup notes in shared channel; blockers escalated within 24 hours.
  - Shared decision log living in `docs/migration/decisions.md`.
  - Versioned API schema package published to npm workspace for both teams to consume.

## 5. Risk Mitigation & Contingencies
- **Regression Risk**: mitigate by building automated tests before removing legacy code; run both versions in parallel during initial QA.
- **Data Loss**: use migration dry-runs and backups stored in versioned buckets; include rollback scripts.
- **Timeline Creep**: prioritize high-usage views first; defer low-impact screens to later sprints.
- **Team Upskilling**: host workshops on new tooling (TanStack Query, Zustand, Fastify) and document patterns in `docs/architecture/`.
- **Performance**: monitor bundle size (Vite + code splitting) and database query performance; set budgets in CI (e.g., `pnpm run analyze`).
